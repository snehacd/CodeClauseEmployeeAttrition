# Employee Attrition Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. Employee attrition refers to the phenomenon where employees leave the organization, voluntarily or involuntarily. Predicting attrition can be crucial for organizations to take proactive measures to retain valuable talent and manage workforce stability.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about employees such as demographics, job role, satisfaction levels, performance ratings, etc. It also includes a binary target variable indicating whether the employee has left the organization or not.

### Features
- Age
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Education Level
- Job Role
- Department
- Work Experience
- Distance from Home
- Job Satisfaction
- Relationship Satisfaction
- Performance Rating
- Years Since Last Promotion
- Years with Current Manager
- etc.

### Target Variable
- Attrition (1 if the employee left, 0 otherwise)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the data to gain insights into the relationships between various features and attrition. This step involves visualizations and statistical analysis.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

4. **Model Selection**: Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc., to find the best performing model.

5. **Model Training**: Training the selected model(s) on the preprocessed data.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Also, using techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the selected model(s) to improve performance further.

8. **Prediction**: Using the trained model(s) to predict employee attrition on unseen data.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test dataset. Further details on model performance metrics and insights gained from the analysis are provided in the project documentation.
